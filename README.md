This is a program that demonstrates that Vos Savant is correct when solving the Monty Hall problem. Statistics shows, that after the host opens a door, switching doors has higher chances of getting you the price car.

Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Gain an understanding of the problem - perhaps see how your friends react if you play the part of the host.
- [x] Convince yourself that Vos Savant was correct.
- [x] Design and write software that will run sample games employing either the stick or switch strategy.
- [x] Put the code in a public GitHub repository
- [x] Use your software to show that switching doors is statistically the best option.
- [x] The elegance of the output is not important so long as the program can be used to prove the point.
